# Exercise 1: Greetings!

# Write a Python script that asks the user for their name, and then prints a personalized greeting message. This will help you understand how to take input from the user and print it.

# What is your name? John
# Hello, John! Nice to meet you!

print('What is your name?')
name = input()
print(f'Hello, {name}! Nice to meet you!')
