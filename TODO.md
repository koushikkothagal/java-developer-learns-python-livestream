TODO:
- dunder methods
- how odoes paths work when using symlinks?
- Ordering of paths when importing modules. What comes first? How would some one override teh system modules.  This worked for random but not for sys. What's the difference?
- What is this? Python does not check the cache in two circumstances. First, it always recompiles and does not store the result for the module thatâ€™s loaded directly from the command line. Second, it does not check the cache if there is no source module. To support a non-source (compiled only) distribution, the compiled module must be in the source directory, and there must not be a source module.
- Notice that code passed to exec() or eval() does not consider the classname of the invoking class to be the current class; this is similar to the effect of the global statement, the effect of which is likewise restricted to code that is byte-compiled together. The same restriction applies to getattr(), setattr() and delattr(), as well as when referencing __dict__ directly. (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)
- Instance method objects have attributes, too: m.__self__ is the instance object with the method m(), and m.__func__ is the function object corresponding to the method.
