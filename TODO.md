TODO:

- how odoes paths work when using symlinks?
- Ordering of paths when importing modules. What comes first? How would some one override teh system modules.  This worked for random but not for sys. What's the difference?
- What is this? Python does not check the cache in two circumstances. First, it always recompiles and does not store the result for the module thatâ€™s loaded directly from the command line. Second, it does not check the cache if there is no source module. To support a non-source (compiled only) distribution, the compiled module must be in the source directory, and there must not be a source module.
